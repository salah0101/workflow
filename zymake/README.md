Zymake - Computational workflow system for scientific experiments. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zymake is a high-level language for running complex sets of experiments. The user writes a zymakefile, mostly consisting of parameterized shell commands, and zymake determines the dependency structure and executes the commands in the appropriate order.

Zymake is written by Eric Breck and distributed under the BSD license.
